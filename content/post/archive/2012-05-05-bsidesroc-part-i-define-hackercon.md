There&#8217;s only a few days left for this years <a href="http://www.bsidesroc.com" target="_blank">BSidesROC on 5/12/12</a>. **&#8220;Rochester&#8217;s first and only hacker con&#8221;**. << Do you know why we say that? Not because we&#8217;re the only computer security conference, and not because we think other security conferences suck (well some do), but it&#8217;s because an info sec event is not the same as a hacker con. I&#8217;m talking about Rochester Security Summit for example. It&#8217;s been going on for years run by the local ISSA chapter and they do a good job. It is a corporate crowd.  You expect that when you pay a certain amount of money that there&#8217;s a certain level of professionalism. And the people that attend are info sec professionals. A hacker con on the other hand&#8230;

# Con != Conference

&#8220;Con&#8221; used to stand for &#8220;conference&#8221; , and it literally still does but it&#8217;s also a reference to the &#8220;con&#8221; community. Defcon, Shmoocon, Comicon, (FurryCon?). Each of these are conferences but there&#8217;s something else to it. Different. If you&#8217;ve been to <a href="http://www.defcon.org" target="_blank">Defcon </a>or <a href="http://www.shmoocon.org" target="_blank">Shmoocon</a>, your expectation is to have a ton of fun, meet cool people, and take part in fun activities with such people. In some ways, it&#8217;s much more of an intense experience because you&#8217;re not walking in with your button down shirts enjoying a coffee while you sit at the white circle table that hotels always have. That would be a conference. **At Defcon you&#8217;re walking in with a black shirt ready to be punched in the face by awesomeness**. You may look around and notice a lot of younger people but it&#8217;s not that the crowd is necessarily young; it&#8217;s the ideas and the passion usually associated with young people. And that&#8217;s what it comes down to in con versus a conference; passion. These people want to be here, they&#8217;re not being forced by their employers. They want to see what&#8217;s happening in a community.

# Hacker != Infosec

Hacker: That scary word that Rochester is learning to accept. Slowly. You know the word, and the politics behind it. But I think there&#8217;s a big difference between hacker and infosec, both in how they act and the way they think. Hacker and infosec have an overlap of course, but a **hacker refers to someone with a passion to learn about security**. Infosec on the other hand is a job position or career path. It&#8217;s business driven, professional, and pretty easy to define. By day, I am an Information Security professional and I attempt to be professional and goal oriented when it comes to my job. At night, I&#8217;m a hacker that wants to learn things related to security whether or not they benefit my career.

# Y U SO Pedantic

The point is to show that BSidesROC is a different beast than any of the other conferences in Rochester. Maybe it&#8217;s not better if you enjoy professional cons. But definitely better if you have a passion for security and don&#8217;t take life too seriously. And if you don&#8217;t like paying for things. It&#8217;s also a **warning for those people expecting to walk into a comfortable sit-in-your-seat-and-listen event**. Because this is not it. If you haven&#8217;t been to a hacker con, I strongly recommend that you come to this one if for nothing else, to see what a hacker con is like.

By the end of the week, I&#8217;ll include some details about what&#8217;s happening at BSidesROC.
