Rochester&#8217;s version of a [Security B-Sides is coming up next week][1]. There&#8217;s a rush to finalize everything and there might be a question about this new event I&#8217;ve referenced as &#8220;Privacy Workshop&#8221;, &#8220;OPSEC Training&#8221;, or just AntiTree talks for 3 hours. The [Privacy Workshop Track][2]Â is something that came out of an ad-hoc event that @[CJP][3] has been doing for the last couple of BSidesROC&#8217;s. He would walk in and say &#8220;I want to do a key signing party&#8221; and we&#8217;d go &#8220;Awesome!&#8221; and set him up with a table. This workshop/lecture series is an expansion on this idea where we said we&#8217;d like to do more than just key signing, we wanted to teach you what you&#8217;re doing get you started. As GPG is a pretty good answer to some of the surveillance out there, I thought I would expand it into a series of presentations focusing on other tools with a similar goal. I&#8217;ve broken it down into three parts; Connectivity, Communication, and Operations. The tools I&#8217;ll be focusing on will be Tor, TAILS, and GPG. Operational security with TAILS, anonymous connectivity with Tor, and secure communications with GPG.

With Tor, **my main goal is to address the most common questions like &#8220;But I bet the NSA has a backdoor in Tor, right?&#8221;** So I&#8217;ve turned it into a discussion about how Tor works, and ways it can be broken. I&#8217;d be happy to discuss real threats to Tor, but I&#8217;m pretty bored with the &#8220;Tor is funded by the government&#8221; tin-hat talk. I find it actually really interesting the challenges that Tor has so in other words, I&#8217;m just looking for people to have conversations with. ðŸ™‚

GPG and TAILS are both hands on workshops aimed at getting your hands dirty with both of the tools. GPG is pretty straight forward for the most part and I&#8217;ll go into a few extra tips that I think are interesting and then to go through Keybase.io if there&#8217;s time.

With TAILS, I&#8217;ve even built some USB sticks with TAILS prebuilt on them. I thought it might be interesting for the workshop to provide a hands on experience as quickly as possible.

Of course all of this is still up in the air, so I reserve the right to change everything. ðŸ™‚ I&#8217;m just hoping that with all the time I&#8217;m putting into putting this together, there are people actually interested. ðŸ™‚
