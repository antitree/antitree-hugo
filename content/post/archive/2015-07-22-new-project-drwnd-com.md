I don&#8217;t remember the exact conversation, but Jason Ross inspired me to buy DRWND.com, as in Drone + PWND = DRWND. I&#8217;ve owned it for a bit waiting for some specific data so that I could use it as an informational site about DRWN attacks. As IANA web developer, this has been interesting and terrible but simple enough to share.

  <a href="http://www.drwnd.com">www.drwnd.com</a>
</h2>

<p style="text-align: left;">
  <p style="text-align: left;">
    I won&#8217;t assume the site makes any sense right now so I can summarize it like this:
  </p>
  
  <ul>
    <li style="text-align: left;">
      It takes a data feed of all known locations of drone strikes and plots them
    </li>
    <li style="text-align: left;">
      Circle size reflects the number of people killed
    </li>
    <li style="text-align: left;">
      Circle color reflect the percentage of the deaths that were civilians and/or children in an RGB manner <ul>
        <li style="text-align: left;">
          Red &#8211; civilians
        </li>
        <li style="text-align: left;">
          Green &#8211; expected targets or unknowns
        </li>
        <li style="text-align: left;">
          Blue &#8211; children
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    
    <li style="text-align: left;">
      For example the done strike in Pakistan that is purple reflects that people were mostly civilians and children
    </li>
  </ul>
  
  <p>
    All this being said, the data comes from <a href="http://www.dronestre.am">Dronestre.am</a> which attempts to be honest but there&#8217;s no way that it can be complete nor totally accurate.
