Now that BSidesROC is over and the CTF is closed, I can share some of the details 
about the Onions CTF category that I made. I think the feedback was that a lot of the
challenges were too hard or they were straight-forward but they took too long to do.

## Setup

Each of the services in the Onions category contained a vanity BSidesROC onion address.
This was thanks to my friend who threw some GPU cycles at generating keys for services
that either start with or end with "bsidesroc". 

## BSidesROC NAS Format

I'll be honest, this entire challenge was just an attempt to used the awesome onion 
service named "BSidesROCNAS4mat.onion". 

```
This challenge may seem a bit vain
Overthink it, Ull go insane
2 B an onion U must B 16
Look at the name and Ull see what eye mean
```

By visiting [http://bsidesrocnas4mat.onion](http://bsidesrocnas4mat.onion) you're taken to a web page talking about the BSidesROC NAS Formatting As A Services (NAS FaaS).

From there, I gave a few hints if you happened to go to /admin it showed: "Oh so you're looking for an admin section? Not here but keep looking around." 

If you could either guess `cgi-bin` as a valid path or read the robots.txt file which listed that as one of the directories, you could go to that site and retrive the key.

One group got this one.

## Sans Bullshit Cyber

This challenge was a little bit of reverse engineering and a little bit to show off
the difference between Tor Browser Bundle and a normal browser. 

Here is the description:

```
The Tor Browser Bundle's cyber synergy uses big data and epic emerging webinars for discovery and diversity as a defense in depth design pattern. 

    http://bsidesrocvfano5q.onion
```

The back story is that years ago, someone made a custom font called [Sans Bullshit Sans](http://www.sansbullshitsans.com/)
which used ligatures to replace words like "synergy" and other sales-y terms with "bullshit"
"bs" or "bull-fucking-shit". I spun off another version I called [Sans Bullshit Cyber Sans](https://github.com/antitree/SansBullshitCyberSans)
which just added in some common security terms like "cyber", "defense-in-depth", and "cloud".
I used it for the Rochester 2600 presentations so whenever a news article had a buzzword in
it, it would be replaced with "bullshit." 

In this case, the onion service hosted a page that showed off a demo of this font. But
if you didn't know that Tor Browser Bundle blocks third party fonts, now you should. Because
the demo only worked on a stanard browser like Chrome or Firefox that supported including
of a remotely  hosted font. 

The second part of it was knowing how to reverse engineer a font. In linux you can do this 
by downloading the font and simply run the `ttx` command that you'll find in the `fonttools`
package on Debian-based distros. The ttx file will look something like this:

```
<LigatureSet glyph="b">
   <Ligature components="y,o,d" glyph="uniE601"/>
   <Ligature components="e,t,a" glyph="uniE602"/>
   <Ligature components="a,l,l,s" glyph="uniE600"/>
   <Ligature components="i,g,space,d,a,t,a" glyph="uniE601"/>
   <Ligature components="l,u,e,p,r,i,n,t" glyph="uniE601"/>
   <Ligature components="a,n,d,w,i,d,t,h" glyph="uniE601"/>
   <Ligature components="r,o,g,r,a,m,m,e,r" glyph="uniE601"/>
   <Ligature components="o,t,t,o,m,space,l,i,n,e" glyph="uniE601"/>
   <Ligature components="o,u,n,c,e,space,r,a,t,e" glyph="uniE601"/>
   <Ligature components="l,e,e,d,i,n,g,space,e,d,g,e" glyph="uniE600"/>
   <Ligature components="e,s,t,space,o,f,space,b,r,e,e,d" glyph="uniE600"/>
   <Ligature components="e,s,t,space,p,r,a,c,t,i,c,e,s" glyph="uniE600"/>
   <Ligature components="o,i,l,space,t,h,e,space,o,c,e,a,n" glyph="uniE600"/>
   <Ligature components="e,l,o,w,space,t,h,e,space,f,o,l,d" glyph="uniE600"/>
   <Ligature components="r,a,n,d,space,e,v,a,n,g,e,l,i,s,t" glyph="uniE600"/>
   <Ligature components="r,i,c,k,s,space,a,n,d,space,c,l,i,c,k,s" glyph="uniE600"/>
   <Ligature components="r,i,n,g,space,t,o,space,t,h,e,space,p,a,r,t,y" glyph="uniE600"/>
   <Ligature components="r,i,n,g,space,t,o,space,t,h,e,space,t,a,b,l,e" glyph="uniE600"/>
   <Ligature components="s,i,d,e,s,r,o,c,T,O,E,S,C,A,N" glyph="uniE600"/>
```

You'll see an odd ligature at the end which we joke is the opposite of "FINGER PRINT". No one
got this one.

I'll try to have more time to explain a few of the other ones.
