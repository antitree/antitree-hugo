One of Docker's many updates this year was adding [seccomp](https://docs.docker.com/engine/security/seccomp/) support.
In short, seccomp/secomp-bpf is a way of filtering the system calls that
you want to allow an application to make. It's used for sandboxing enforcement
it a lot of projects including [Chromium](https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src/+/lkcr/docs/linux_sandboxing.md), [bubblewrap](https://github.com/projectatomic/bubblewrap), and [SubgraphOS](https://github.com/subgraph/oz/wiki/Oz-Seccomp).

In Docker, it's enabled by default (in supported environments) and has a [default profile](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/moby/moby/master/profiles/seccomp/default.json) that is
fine, but there's always ways to customize it. (Even you should never do this.)

**It's academic to say "You should use custom seccomp profiles for each of your
containers!"** and you'll fall victim to
easier-said-than-done-ism. I think that using custom seccomp profiles for each
container is a great way to help defend against container breakouts but actually
doing that, at scale, is a nightmare. But possible. And something that <s>will</s>might get better.

If you're not concerned about needing to restrict your container to custom seccomp
profiles, you can be afraid of the.. we'll call it... "agile" nature Docker and
be concerned that the Docker default profile might change and break something
for your container. [That would never happen though right?](https://fossies.org/diffs/docker/1.12.6_vs_1.13.0/profiles/seccomp/default.json-diff.html)
To be fair, AFAIK that's just reorganizing the profile, not changing the policy.

As of today, **there are more than 300 syscalls that are whitelisted by default.
Your blog probably doesn't need that many.**

## How to seccomp in Docker

How to you run a docker container with seccomp enabled? Run docker. Done.
But to load a custom profile it's just something like this:
```
docker run --security-opt seccomp=$PWD/customseccomp.json nginx
```

## Docker's seccomp json format
You can look at [Docker's default seccomp profile](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/moby/moby/master/profiles/seccomp/default.json)
yourself. Their default profile is a whitelist of all the possible syscalls that
the container can make. You can filter out a containers ability accept
network connections like so:

```
"syscalls": [
               {
                       "name": "accept",
                       "action": "SCMP_ACT_ALLOW",
                       "args": []
               },
```

I'm stopping there because it gets much more complicated. We'll come back to
that another day.

## Strace

You might know that [strace](https://linux.die.net/man/1/strace) is designed for
this job. Here's a few `strace`
examples that might be useful for containers:

Strace wget with absolute timestamps:

`strace -ttt wget https://www.google.com`

Strace nginx with multiprocess support:

`strace -ff -o /tmp/nginx.strace nginx`

Strace ls and summarize all of the syscalls they made:

`strace -c ls -la`

```bash
% time     seconds  usecs/call     calls    errors syscall

Ok now just run this on Docker. Oh wait. How does that work? How would you run
strace on just a single container?

The answer is you can modify the image to include strace and modify the
entry-point to run the normal command with strace. Here's an example
using [featherduster's docker file](https://github.com/nccgroup/featherduster/blob/master/Dockerfile):

```Python
FROM ubuntu:xenial

RUN apt-get update -qq && apt-get install -qq \
        build-essential \
        libncurses-dev \
        libgmp3-dev \
        python-crypto \
        python-dev \
        python-pip \
        python-setuptools \
        strace
    && rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*

COPY . /opt/featherduster
WORKDIR /opt/featherduster
RUN pip install -U pip
RUN pip install .
RUN mkdir /strace

ENTRYPOINT ["/usr/bin/strace", "-ff", "-o", "/strace/feather.strace","python", "/opt/featherduster/featherduster/featherduster.py"]
```
I'm adding `strace` to the list of packages to install. Creating a directory
called "/strace" to hold the logs. And then changing it from executing
`python pythonscript.py` to `strace python pythonscript.py`.

I can rebuild it with
```
docker build -t antitree/featherduster .
```

Run it and grant the SYS_PTRACE capability to the container
```
docker run -it \
  -v $PWD/strace:/strace \
  --cap-add SYS_PTRACE \
  antitree/featherduster
```

You'll see I'm mounting a "/strace" folder to store the logs outside of the
container.

Now it's your job to make sure your container executes every possible function
to illicit every possible syscall. Easy right? Are you starting to appreciate
what SubgraphOS is doing? :)

## Strace output

That was a lot of annoying work right? You're just getting started. You only
now have a log of the syscalls that were caught by `strace`. Lets get a summary
of those syscalls:

`cat strace.log| awk -F '(' '{print $1}' | sort | uniq -c`

In my case that gave me 32 syscalls.

So you're done. **Now just do this for every Docker image in your organization,
compile the results, and port them to individual seccomp profiles. Easy!**

## sysdig

I hope you're still reading through all that mundaine explanation and you've
gotten to this point because
`strace` is the defacto tool for this kind of thing but the company/tool
[sysdig](https://www.sysdig.org/wiki/sysdig-examples/) is making a name for themselves in the
container arena by building tools that have native container support. Their
`sysdig` tool fills the gap that we're talking about here.

Run sysdig and show all the calls from a container named suspicious_ether

`sysdig container.name=suspicious_ether`

Run the ncurses client csysdig looking at running containers

`csysdig vcontainers`

![csysdig](/img/2017_csysdig.png)

That's just the beginning of this tool. It has support for all kinds of different
export formats to make scripting pretty easy. Eventually you can see my tool that
converts the syscalls from their output directly to Docker seccomp profiles.

## Making the profile

UPDATE: [See the syscall2seccomp post]({{< relref "post/2017-09-11.md" >}})

This post is already too long and I hope I come back to update it with how to
convert these into Docker seccomp profiles. In short, you'll want to take the
list of those syscalls that you've captured and make a whitelist of syscalls you
need.

Even better, the "bpf" part of "seccomp-bpf" allows you not just control syscalls
but also control the syscall arguments. Does your container need to be able to
`read` the "WORKDIR" folder but not the "/etc/" folder? You can make a restriction
for this.

(Again, a shout-out to SubgraphOS which made their own seccomp profile system
  complete with whitelists and blacklists AND they go the extra mile to restrict
  arguments.)

BTW, what do you do when your tool didn't correctly capture the syscall?
Yes, that's something you have to worry about.

## Summary

* Seccomp is great. Custom seccomp profiles are great (in theory).
* Finding syscalls is time consuming and doesn't scale for large oranizations
* `strace` or `sysdig` (or [dtrace](http://dtrace.org/blogs/about/) for that matter)
are the tools to help

This is a gap in the container security world. There are some projects coming out
that see this and are trying to take advantage of it to make it easier and scale
out to the organization. [AquaSec](https://www.aquasec.com/) is a start-up
trying to get into this space. They wouldn't admit to me whether or not they're
building custom seccomp profiles but their whole thing is to build a secure
container lifecycle.
