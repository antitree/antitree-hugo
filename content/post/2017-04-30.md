This is a continuation of [the previous]({{< relref "post/2017-04-26.md" >}}) [posts]({{< relref "post/2017-04-29.md" >}}) talking about BSidesROC onion related CTF challenges. 

## Port of Onion (PoO)

I don't think anyone got this one mostly because I think they were expecting 
that it was going to take too long. 

Here's the clue: 
```
Sail with me on a 3 hour cruise
A storm hits us hard but we must not lose
Take any port in a storm
Just to get some place warm
There's only one there; which do you choose?


    bsidesrocxehooxr.onion
```

Most picked up that my terrible poem was to try and guess which port
the service was running on. I thought this would be an interesting
challenge to either try to adapt a port scanner to use a socks proxy
or script it. I think people assumed that they'd have to scan 65535
ports but it was hosted on port 1080/TCP which is above 1024 I know but
I was hoping that it would be a common port that a scanner would hit. 

The ways off the top of my head you could figure this out:

* [Python3 threaded requests that uses the socks proxy](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/12601316/how-to-make-python-requests-work-via-socks-proxy)
* [Wget using the SOCKS5 environment variable](https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/38755/how-to-download-a-file-through-an-ssh-server)
* [Modifying your DNS server so that tor resolves .onion domains and 
use nmap.](http://seclists.org/nmap-dev/2015/q2/317)
