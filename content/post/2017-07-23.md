The annual Privacy Enhancing Technologies Symposium (PETS) 2017 is a privacy
nerd's dream and has always been on my list to attend. Unfortunately, it's not
really designed for individuals or non-academics but all the papers are readily
available online so yay, open access!

Here's a few notes about some interesting research presented at PETS 2017
based on the [papers](https://petsymposium.org/2017/program.php) that were released and the live tweets that Nick Mathewson
was doing during the event.

## A Wide-Area Testbed for Tor ##
This was presented by some of the people from the Tor Project along with
researchers from the Navy. (Reminded me that Tor Project folks still have
friends in the Navy. Let the conspiracy theories continue.)

I've personally heard a lot of people want to do something like this research
topic -- basically, **I want to run a tor network that doesn't affect the Tor
Network**. In fact, I believe that RIT was making efforts to do this and
as I look at the authors, guess
[who's listed as an author](https://www.rit.edu/gccis/computingsecurity/people/matthew-wright).
I've done experiments in this direction using [Docker Swarm](https://github.com/antitree/private-tor-network) but this paper
is talking about taking it to the next level.

The goal here is to setup a test environment that parities the Tor Network so
you can run large scale experiments without affecting real-world tor clients.
Some of the benefits:

* Practical traffic analysis
* Impact on attacks such as [RAPTOR](https://www.usenix.org/system/files/conference/usenixsecurity15/sec15-paper-sun.pdf)
* Testing fault tolerance
* Testing Performance

Right now it's just gaging interest but I think if it's funded, it could push
anonymity research. I just question how open it will be or if this is going to
be another private Tor Project system.

## The Onion Name system
Tor's onion services are going to be headed into some [major changes soon](https://blog.torproject.org/blog/cooking-onions-names-your-onions).
One of them being bumping up their hashes from SHA1 to SHA256 which  means that
instead of onion addresses like
[`facebookcorewwwi.onion`](http://lifehacker.com/facebook-unveils-a-tor-friendly-onion-address-for-ano-1654081929)
You're going to get hostnames like `odmmeotgcfx65l5hn6ejkaruvai222vs7o7tmtllszqk5xbysolfdd.onion`
that are 54 characters long. You can [read the whole problem here](https://blog.torproject.org/blog/cooking-onions-names-your-onions).

The idea can be simply summarized as an anonymous DNS-like system but the
design problems are very complicated. The paper defines them as:

* Allow anonymous registration for .tor domain names
* (Continue to) Allow anonymous domain lookups
* Cryptographic guarantees on the authenticity of the domain
* Provide unique domain names
* Be decentalized to reduce risk of a single point of failure that would have
catastrophic results
* Be fast, lightweight, and extensible

On first read it seemed like an over-engineered solution looking at
the challenges it's trying to solve, it makes a lot of sense. There are a
lot of moving parts to summarize but let me highlight a few interesting aspects:

The architecture has three parts: OnioNS-client to be run with the tor client
software, OnioNS-server running a micro HTTP server, and OnioNS-HS for the
onion/hidden service it's hosted on.

You can run your own OnioNS server and claim a domain name on top of the .tor
TLD. So *I could run `antitree.tor` and provide subhost registrations for hosts like
`mywebservice.antitree.tor`*.

The system uses [Bitcoin Beacon](https://arxiv.org/abs/1605.04559) as a seed
of verifiable randomness. I get the feeling that it would eventually move
away from relying on the Bitcoin Network for that and instead used the
new [Tor Shared Randomness](https://blog.torproject.org/blog/whats-new-tor-0298)
 feature they've recently added.

Unlike [NameCoin](https://github.com/petertodd/namecoin/blob/master/DESIGN-namecoin.md) which has a similar design, there's a defense against domain
squatters so that it's not first-come-first-serve. As I understand it (high
risk of being wrong here), a person can register for a host by performing a
proof-of-work calculation and generating a ticket. A ticket is sent to OnioNS
and Quorum nodes (ala the blockchain) who determine a subset of registrants
that "have won the lottery" based on how much effort the registrant put in to
make the ticket. In the end a record is created that will
point `mywebservice.antitree.tor` to
`odmmeotgcfx65l5hn6ejkaruvai222vs7o7tmtllszqk5xbysolfdd.onion` and this is
served by OnioNS mirrors distributed around the network and authentication
is performed by putting a root domain signature into the consensus document.

It's crazy enough to work but it still sounds to me that you're making a lot
of 6 hop circuits during communications. When a browser connects to a .tor
domain, it will lookup the service location and establish an introduction point.
The client will then route through 3 hops and the service will also route through
3 meaning every "lookup" is done this way. After that, the corresponding
.onion domain is returned and has to do that same 6+ hop circuit. I believe
there's even more overhead than that but that alone is going to be a pretty
intense usability problem for onion services.

This does seem like the best option out of all of the options thus far.
